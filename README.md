# Shooting Video &amp; Recording Audio

## Workshop
__Shooting Video &amp; Recording Audio__ is a 50-minute workshop and handout to teach and learn how to plan out a video project by Jesse Garcia.

Jesse created the workshop as part of the Humboldt State University [SkillShops](http://humboldt.libcal.com/workshops) series as a [Digital Media & Learning Intern](http://libguides.humboldt.edu/dml/apply) in Spring 2018. The original workshops were offered on [April 3](https://humboldt.libcal.com/event/4048535) and [April 4](https://humboldt.libcal.com/event/4048537), 2018.

## Handouts
Jesse also works with Access Humboldt and borrowed a storyboarding worksheet they were gracious enough to let us include in this workshop.

Lydia's activities use material from [_How cats evolved to win the Internet_](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/16/opinion/sunday/how-cats-evolved-to-win-the-internet.html) by Abigail Tucker.
